**Why I Made This**

Made this because I needed to get a few hundred bust pictures of players for the yearbook. This will also be used for our newspaper. I would enjoy seeing what uses other people find for these pictures. 

**Color Choices**

The set colors are just the colors from the most popular color palette on the most popular color palette website. Intended to be a shotgun approach to finding the best background color for a particular skin. My next big update to this project will add a GUI to more easily change those colors on the fly, but for now just download and change in the code.

**Python Packages**

This is my first tool built using Python packages not included in Python itself. Please just use PyCharm's GUI for getting Selenium and Pillow. Refer to Selenium's installation guide for putting the Firefox drivers in the right place.
